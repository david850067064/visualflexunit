Visual FlexUnit is an [Allurent](http://www.allurent.com) open source project to establish a framework for the testing of components' visual appearance.  The goal is to enhance FlexUnit with additional features to support "visual assertions". In a nutshell, a visual assertion asserts that a component's appearance is identical to a stored baseline image file.

Tests can be run using a GUI interface or through an Ant build process.

Documentation is in this Google Code project's [main wiki page](http://code.google.com/p/visualflexunit/wiki/VisualFlexUnit) and in the `/visualflexunit/asDocs/` folder in the visualflexunit.zip download file.
