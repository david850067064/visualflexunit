        Most projects use the default value for this prop, which is "src"
        This project's code is divided into src/air and src/flex and, obviously, we are only including
        the latter in this automated build process. This doesn't create problems, at least for the
        present, because we are only using the AIR code for the AIR GUI, which we build in FlexBuilder
